# Creating your own Route Files

To create your own route file go to www.google.ca/maps and establish a start and end destination. Then go into the map and identify the straight segments and their lat/long along the route. To figure out the lat/long in google maps right-click on a point in the road and then in the pull-down select the lat/long to copy the data to the clipboard. You can then paste this data into a text file along with an estimate of the speed limit for that segment. You donâ€™t have the same real-time data for the average speed for each segment but your distances should be very similar!
